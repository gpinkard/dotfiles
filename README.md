### GABRIEL'S DOT/CONFIGURATION FILES

Configuration files for my ever evolving linux rice. This readme primarily serves to 
remind me what particular packages I need to get to make sure everything runs smoothly,
but feel free to grab anything you want.

- neovim: Get vim-plug, then do :PlugInstall 

- .zshrc: Just use oh-my-zsh (put pointer theme in .oh-my-zsh/custom/themes, or use powerlevel9k). 

- termite/config: grab Source Code Pro font

- i3/config (i3-gaps): needs rofi, ranger, w3m (ranger image previews), compton, feh, i3-lock

- ranger: Make sure EDITOR global in /etc/profile is set to nvim so it does not open
things with nano.

- i3blocks/polybar: see github pages for dependencies (grab font awesome for polybar)
