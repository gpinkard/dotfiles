### GABRIEL'S DOT/CONFIGURATION FILES ###

Configuration files for my ever evolving linux rice. This readme primarily serves to 
remind me what particular packages I need to get to make sure everything runs smoothly,
but feel free to grab anything you want.

1. neovim: Get vim-plug, then do :PlugInstall 

2. .zshrc: Just use oh-my-zsh, grab powerlevel9k + powerline fonts. 

3. termite/config: nothing special needed :o

4. i3/config (i3-gaps): needs rofi, ranger, compton

5. ranger: Make sure EDITOR global in /etc/profile is set to nvim so it does not open
things with nano.

6. polybar: Grab FontAwesome, as well as UW ttyp0. See polybar wiki for large list
of module dependencies.
